Your **World Trade Indices Monitoring Dashboard** has been successfully prepared for production deployment! This guide provides multiple deployment options for your real-time stock market monitoring application.

## 📋 What's Been Optimized

✅ **Next.js Configuration**: Standalone output for self-contained builds  
✅ **Performance**: SWC minification, compression, and optimized imports  
✅ **Error Handling**: Robust API fallbacks and graceful error states  
✅ **Build Process**: Clean production build with zero linting errors  
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive deployment instructions  
✅ **Docker Support**: Multi-stage Dockerfile for containerized deployment  

## 🎯 Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Standard Production Build (Recommended for most users)
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
Access at: http://localhost:3000

### Option 2: Automated Deployment Script
```bash
./deploy.sh
```
This script handles the complete build and deployment process automatically.

### Option 3: Standalone Build (Best for cloud deployment)
```bash
npm run build
cd .next/standalone
node server.js
```

### Option 4: Docker Container (Best for scalability)
```bash
docker build -t indices-monitor .
docker run -p 3000:3000 indices-monitor
```

      "isRealData": true
    }
  ],
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "note": "All data is real-time"
}
```

## 🚀 Deployment Platforms

### Vercel (Zero Configuration)
1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically

### Netlify
1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Publish directory: `.next`

### AWS/GCP/Azure
